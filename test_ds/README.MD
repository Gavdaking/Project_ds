# 🔐 Hashing and Collision Resolution in C++

This project demonstrates two core concepts in hashing using C++:
- **Folding Method** (Hashing Function)
- **Linear Probing** (Collision Resolution)

It includes:
- ✅ Well-commented C++ code
- 📊 Graphs and comparison tables
- 🎯 Sample tracing of inputs
- 📽️ A full PowerPoint & Google Slides presentation

----

## 🔢 Folding Method – Overview

A simple technique to hash large numbers by:
- Splitting the key into equal segments
- Summing the segments
- Taking modulo of the total with table size
---
## 🔁 Linear Probing – Overview

Handles collisions by checking the next available index in the hash table.
--- 
## 📽️ Presentation Criteria Met

✅ Clear concept explanation  
✅ Code demo and tracing  
✅ Creative visuals  
✅ Real-world use cases with pros and cons
